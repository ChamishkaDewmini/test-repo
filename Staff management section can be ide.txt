Staff management section can be identified as another important section in our leisure
management system. When gathering requirements, we found that an employee management
system should be included in our leisure management system. This section handles all employee-
related tasks in our system including employee registration, leave evaluation, and salary
management. The administrator is the main actor in this section and he is the one who has the
responsibility to manage all employees of the system.
When new employees are recruited, the operation manager is the one who registers those
employees into the system. To register employees to the system, Operation Manager can enter
their personal details like name, address, age, date of birth etc. along with their qualifications and
the job role they recruited. It's a common thing that changes are happening in employees' personal
details such as addresses, and phone numbers. So, the operation manager can edit employee details
whenever such an update is necessary to the employee personal profile. Also, when an employee
resigns from the company, the operation manager can delete his details from the system. To delete
an employee’s entry form, the operation manager should enter a valid reason before deleting it.
Whenever an employee wants to get a leave, it should be approved by the operation manager. It's
a common thing that employees want leave for their required things. When an employee applies
for a leave from his leave page, approval from the operation manager is mandatory to process the
leave. Operation Manager can approve or reject the leave requests of the employees. If the
operation manager approves only, the employee can use his leave.
The salary management part is a very critical section of every business. In this system the salary
assigning part is done in this employee management section by the operation manager. Operation
Manager can assign the salaries, bonuses and OT allocated for each and every employee in the
system and can finalize them.
The employee management section generates reports including monthly employee salary reports
and monthly net income profit reports. Employee salary report generated based on employees’
salaries. Net income profit report generates based on total income and liabilities business has.
